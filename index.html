   <p>In 1993, game design was starting to transition into the third dimension, Wolfenstein 3D was released a year before in 1992, Doom was right around the corner and a new competitor would enter the industry a year later, the Super Nintendo was doing well around this time, but it would be rendered obsolete a year by the PlayStation. However, Argonaut Software joined Nintendo by pitching them a demo of a 3D game on the Gameboy. Nintendo was impressed to which Argonaut had an enhancement chip called the Super FX chip developed. The development team at Argonaut created all of the models, but Nintendo thought the game needed the classic Nintendo charm by adding characters, the end result is Star Fox, a game that was incredibly technically impressive and was one of the games that kept the Super Nintendo alive for the next few years.

      When Star Fox was released, it was an impressive technical achievement because of how it pulled off fully polygonal graphics on a system that was thought to have not been capable of such a feat and although the graphics may look very outdated these days, I think they hold up pretty well, the basic geometry and lack of textures give the game a unique charm visually, and I'd personally much rather have no textures than the smeary textures of early fifth generation games however, the game does run at around 20fps as a result since it's so complex graphically, but the game is designed with the slow framerate in mind, I have not found a single obstacle, boss, or stage that  asks too much for the player or hindered by the low speed, there are sections in particular that are difficult, but none of them were because of the framerate, I've played Stunt Race FX and that game is a perfect example of poor optimization, the tracks have tight turns and the actual controls feel far too slippery and delayed, whereas Star Fox feels much more precise to control and both games run at the same speed.
      
      Star Fox follows the traditional Shoot 'Em Up gameplay, but with one difference, and it's obviously that it is in 3D. It is not free roaming though, in fact, the stages follow a very linear point A to B structure, and the camera is very limited, and you automatically move forward like in a lot of Shoot 'Em ups. You can however aim in eight directions though. Another big difference is that you can take multiple hits, probably to make it accessible to everybody given Nintendo's standards. The game is still quite a challenge though. The best part of Star Fox is that there are three routes to choose from, each increasing in difficulty. Each start at Corneria and end at Venom, but they have different layouts and design based on the route you pick. Before you start the game there are four configuration options for the controls as well as an optional training mode that teaches the player what buttons do what.
