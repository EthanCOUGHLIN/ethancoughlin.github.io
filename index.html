   <p>In 1993, game design was starting to transition into the third dimension, Wolfenstein 3D was released a year before in 1992, Doom was right around the corner and a new competitor would enter the industry a year later, the Super Nintendo was doing well around this time, but it would be rendered obsolete a year by the PlayStation. However, Argonaut Software joined Nintendo by pitching them a demo of a 3D game on the Gameboy. Nintendo was impressed to which Argonaut had an enhancement chip called the Super FX chip developed. The development team at Argonaut created all of the models, but Nintendo thought the game needed the classic Nintendo charm by adding characters, the end result is Star Fox, a game that was incredibly technically impressive and was one of the games that kept the Super Nintendo alive for the next few years.
   </p>
   <p>When Star Fox was released, it was an impressive technical achievement because of how it pulled off fully polygonal graphics on a system that was thought to have not been capable of such a feat and although the graphics may look very outdated these days, I think they hold up pretty well, the basic geometry and lack of textures give the game a unique charm visually, and I'd personally much rather have no textures than the smeary textures of early fifth generation games however, the game does run at around 20fps as a result since it's so complex graphically, but the game is designed with the slow framerate in mind, I have not found a single obstacle, boss, or stage that  asks too much for the player or hindered by the low speed, there are sections in particular that are difficult, but none of them were because of the framerate, I've played Stunt Race FX and that game is a perfect example of poor optimization, the tracks have tight turns and the actual controls feel far too slippery and delayed, whereas Star Fox feels much more precise to control and both games run at the same speed.
   </p>
   <p>Star Fox follows the traditional Shoot 'Em Up gameplay, but with one difference, and it's obviously that it is in 3D. It is not free roaming though, in fact, the stages follow a very linear point A to B structure, and the camera is very limited, and you automatically move forward like in a lot of Shoot 'Em ups. You can however aim in eight directions though. Another big difference is that you can take multiple hits, probably to make it accessible to everybody given Nintendo's standards. The game is still quite a challenge though. The best part of Star Fox is that there are three routes to choose from, each increasing in difficulty. Each start at Corneria and end at Venom, but they have different layouts and design based on the route you pick. Before you start the game there are four configuration options for the controls as well as an optional training mode that teaches the player what buttons do what.
   </p>
   <p>Corneria is a great first stage and a great tutorial, it is easy and allows the player to acclimate to how the game works whilst still being an action packed stage. The Asteroid Belt takes things up a notch as the player is in an asteroid field where they have to avoid rocks by dodging them or shooting through destructible ones. I quite like this stage as it is thrilling to have asteroids coming towards you and it is all the more satisfying to successfully dodge them. The Space Armada stage however is my favorite, it is such an action packed spectacle seeing the battleships of Andross's space armada as it makes the stage feel very epic in scope and it is super satisfying to destroy the other enemy battleships. It gets even better as you go into the ships and destroy their energy cores, it is still very challenging though with the amount of enemies coming towards you and the projectiles they fire. The Planet Meteor takes things down a notch in terms of the spectacle but it increases in difficulty as it has the player going through the stage faster than in other stages. Venom has two parts to it, the first is in outer space heading into the orbit of the planet, and the second is on the planet grounds, both are quite challenging in their own way, whilst the first part has hordes of enemies coming towards you, the second is the ultimate test of the player's skills with blocks that appear, fall in a particular pattern and gate blocks that close on you, it's a great finale as it really keeps the player on the edge of there seat trying to dodge all of the obstacles.
   </p>
   <p>The second route once again starts at Corneria, however the level design is slightly altered which makes things a bit more refreshing and adds a bit of variety to the same level which encourages playing through all of the routes which adds to the replay value. Sector X is an entirely different level from the asteroid belt, as the focus of this stage is to dodge blocks rather than asteroids, and unlike the asteroids, there are none that can be shot. Titania is a planet that has lost it's weather control and is snowy as a result, it takes things back a little and is one of the easier stages in the game, the middle section has these doors and you have to open one of them to access the switch that restores the weather control back to normal, I like the use of the doors as they require the player to use their head to get through the stage. Sector Y was rather irritating at first but got better, the irritating bit was with the stingrays as there are two of them onscreen and you can't hit them or else they will do huge amounts of damage and you have to make sure to shoot everything else with them onscreen, but this difficulty is nothing compared to the later stages. Whilst the first part of Venom is entirely the same as before but with different enemy positions, the second part is completely different here than in the first route, both visually and design wise. The stage is essentially a hallway leading into the core of the base, it is quite thrilling to shoot down the big enemy ships and dodging the beams that come up through the ground and fighting the hoverbike enemies that fall behind the player.

   <p>The third and final route begins with Corneria but with a sunset background in addition to the slightly altered layout. The Asteroid Belt kicks things up dramatically in the difficulty, the increased touch damage drastically reduces the amount of times you can get hit and there are incredibly difficult enemies that latch onto the asteroids and shoot at you and if that isn't enough the asteroids go towards you when you shoot them off of it and there are asteroids that even home in on you and you have to dodge, you really have to be careful in this stage. Fortuna gets even more difficult with enemies coming towards you that you have to hit multiple times, that and in the second section are birds that will come towards you and hit you if you don't defeat them in time and dragons that if not defeated will sometimes send fireballs that will hit you from behind. Sector Z is a little easier as it is mostly just dodging blocks just like in Sector X, however some of the blocks are wireframed (probably to add a bit of visual variety in the stages), however it doesn't go down that much in difficulty as the blocks are in a more difficult pattern than Sector X. Macbeth is a really cool looking stage, I love the red and orange tones as it really gives it the feeling that you're within the depths of an incredibly heated planet, otherwise the stage isn't too difficult. The first part of Venom is once again the same and the second is visually the same as the first route in the same location, however the level design is significantly more difficult as the patterns are far more complex and there is many more of them, I quite like this as it adds a lot of intensity and it is all the more satisfying to dodge the blocks.
