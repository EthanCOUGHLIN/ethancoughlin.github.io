    <p>Method</p>
        <p>STEP 1</p>
        <p>Line eight holes of a 12-hole cupcake tin with paper cases. Tip the cookies into a food processor and blitz to a fine crumb, or do this in a bowl using the end of a rolling pin. Measure 215g of the crumbs into a bowl and mix in the melted butter. Divide the mixture between the paper cases, pressing it into the bases slightly.</p>
        
        <p>STEP 2</p>
        <p>Pour the cream, condensed milk and 55g of the remaining crushed cookies into a bowl, and whisk until just starting to thicken, about 5 mins. Spoon the mixture evenly over the chocolate cookie bases, then freeze for at least 2 hrs or overnight until solid. Will keep frozen for up to two days.</p>
        
        <p>STEP 3</p>
        <p>Just before serving, make the topping. Whip the cream with the icing sugar using an electric whisk until its a pipeable consistency. Spoon into a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle and pipe a swirl of whipped cream over each cupcake. Decorate each with a whole cookie and remaining cookie crumbs. Serve immediately.</p>
